Finish Actors, NPCs and Players
Finish Room
Finish RoomManager
Finish DatabaseManager
Finish BuffManager - Truesight needs adding to the list
Finish OLC
Reload command for Imms to reload game assets from the DB
Websockets / API interface so we can add/edit/remove items from an app instead of OLC - https://chatgpt.com/c/671a694c-79a4-8001-9ecc-4ede06f0ddde - https support needed
Add a ReleaseLock function so Imms can turn off locks on objects if needed
Check Remove for all OLC items to make sure we remove them from teh database as well as the managers
add mudhelp command and help manager to get/update entries - new db table?
