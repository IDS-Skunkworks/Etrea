Finish Actors, NPCs and Players
Finish Room
Finish RoomManager
Finish DatabaseManager
Finish BuffManager - Truesight needs adding to the list
Finish OLC
Reload command for Imms to reload game assets from the DB
Websockets / API interface so we can add/edit/remove items from an app instead of OLC - https://chatgpt.com/c/671a694c-79a4-8001-9ecc-4ede06f0ddde - https support needed
Add a ReleaseLock function so Imms can turn off locks on objects if needed
Check Remove for all OLC items to make sure we remove them from teh database as well as the managers
add mudhelp command and help manager to get/update entries - new db table?

Look at where functions take or return a string and see about altering to ReadOnlySpan<char> - System.Memory
Look at random numbers - make sure we use Helpers.GetRandom<T> where possible and make sure the Random is static and seeded


        // TODO: Add scripts to rooms for environment effects - probably need more LUA functions exposing - whole system needs documenting
        Need to update API, admin tool and OLC to take account of RoomProg and MobProg in ScriptObjectManager

        // For live database, the Room JSON will need to be updated:
        UPDATE tblRooms
SET RoomData = REPLACE(RoomData, '"LongDescription"', '"MorningDescription"')
WHERE RoomData LIKE '%LongDescription%';


select * from tblRooms where RoomData like '%’%'


        // TODO: All functions related to RoomProgs go here
        // take a look at what we do in mobprogs - think about what actions we want the roomprog to be able to do:
        // - environment effect (magic lamps turning on/off etc) - need two versions:
        //      1. Send an environment message to all players (formatting and message provided by roomprog)
        //      2. Send an environment message depending on time of day (eg if time changes from afternoon to evening, or night to morning)
        // - spawn item / npc
        // - de-spawn item / npc if it exists
        // - get random number
        // - get random player / npc

        // add purgeall and destroyall to remove all npcs/items in all rooms
        words of power - perhaps to affect weather, mobs, etc - flags on player default of none
